  <h2>Description</h2>

  <p>This eggplant lasagna recipe uses eggplant instead of pasta for a delicious meal.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil for brushing</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 large eggplants, peeled and sliced into 1/2-inch rounds</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>48 ounces chunky tomato sauce (such as PregoÂ®)</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>  
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
            Grease 2 baking sheets and a 9x13-inch baking dish with 1 teaspoon olive oil.</li>
        <li>Whisk together eggs and water in a shallow dish. Combine Parmesan cheese, 
            bread crumbs, salt, and pepper in a separate shallow dish.</li>
        <li>Dip eggplant slices into egg mixture, then press into bread crumb mixture. Gently tap off any excess crumbs. 
            Arrange breaded eggplant slices on the prepared baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the bottoms are golden brown, 20 to 25 minutes. 
            Flip eggplant and continue baking until tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Increase the oven temperature to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in ground beef; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until beef is browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes. Drain excess grease. Stir tomato sauce into ground beef; 
            bring to a simmer, then set sauce aside.</li>
        <li>Place 1/3 of the eggplant slices on the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Pour 1/3 of the meat sauce on top of eggplant layer. Sprinkle 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese on top of sauce layer. 
            Repeat this step 2 more times, finishing with a layer of mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and sauce is bubbling, 
            10 to 15 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
